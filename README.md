# Project Analyzer

Welcome to **Project Analyzer**, a tool I originally built to help speed up the learning curve on new projects and programs.

## üöÄ Features

- **Directory Analysis**: Analyze your project's files and directories using the Directory Picker API or file input.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search for variables, functions, imports, and exports across your project.
- **Critical File Detection**: Identify important files like configuration files, entry points, and files with high dependencies.
- **Project Overview**: Get insights into the total number of files, average lines of code, and largest files in your project.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during file scanning and analysis.
- **Beautiful UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide React icons for a clean and modern interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Analyze Your Project**: Click the "Analyze Project" button to start analyzing your project. You can either select a directory using the Directory Picker API or upload files manually.
2. **View Results**: Once the analysis is complete, you'll see an overview of your project, including critical files, project structure, and largest files.
3. **Search Your Code**: Use the search bar to find specific variables, functions, imports, or exports in your project.
4. **Open in VS Code**: Open multiple files directly in VS Code for further exploration.
